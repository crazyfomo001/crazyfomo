## Game Rules

- 5% of each transaction goes into fomo rewarding pool, Fomo3d games’ Initial period is 4 hours, one transaction completed, 30s added, 8 hours top. 

- The last contributer will be rewarded with 20% of the rewarding pool, 
  50% of the rewarding pool will be allocated to the last 6 transaction contributers (including the very last one), based on the share of each transaction.

- Last 30% rewarding will be added to next round. Thus, the pool will always be fill-up, there will always be players.

- The mechanism set the initial transaction on 10000 CFO tokens minimum, the 2ed one is 10003.5 CFO tokens, in this way, it takes at least 330000 CFO tokens to join the game when we come to 10000th transaction.
